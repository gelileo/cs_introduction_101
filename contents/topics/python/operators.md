## Arithmetic Operators:

- `+` (Addition): Adds two numbers.
- `-` (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
- `*` (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers.
- `/` (Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
- `%` (Modulus): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
- `**` (Exponentiation): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
// (Floor Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand and returns the integer result (rounded down).

## Comparison Operators:

- `==` (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.
- `!=` (Not Equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.
- `<` (Less Than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- `>` (Greater Than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- `<=` (Less Than or Equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
- >= (Greater Than or Equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

## Logical Operators:

 - and (Logical AND): Returns True if both operands are True.
 - or (Logical OR): Returns True if at least one operand is True.
 - not (Logical NOT): Returns the opposite of the operand's logical value.

## Assignment Operators:

- = (Assignment): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
- += (Add and Assign): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- -= (Subtract and Assign): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- *= (Multiply and Assign): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- /= (Divide and Assign): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- %= (Modulus and Assign): Calculates the modulus of the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **= (Exponentiate and Assign): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- //= (Floor Division and Assign): Divides the left operand by the right operand using floor division and assigns the result to the left operand.

## Identity Operators:

is: Returns True if both operands are the same object.
is not: Returns True if both operands are not the same object.

## Membership Operators:

in: Returns True if a value is found in a sequence (e.g., a string, list, or tuple).
not in: Returns True if a value is not found in a sequence.
Bitwise Operators (operate on binary representations of numbers):

- & (Bitwise AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation.
- | (Bitwise OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation.
- ^ (Bitwise XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation.
- ~ (Bitwise NOT): Inverts the bits of a number.
- << (Left Shift): Shifts the bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
- `>>` (Right Shift): Shifts the bits to the right by a specified number of positions.
