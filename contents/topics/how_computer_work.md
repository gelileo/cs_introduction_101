# How Computers Work
Computers are complex machines that perform a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to running sophisticated software applications. 

Understanding how computers work involves knowing about their fundamental components and how these components interact to process and store information.

Here's a simplified overview

## Input

Everything starts with an input.

Input Sources:
- keyboard
-


## Processing
`the brain of computer`

- central processing unit (CPU)
- executes instructions and performs calculations
- these instructions are stored in memory and retrieved by the CPU as needed.

Modern CPUs can execute billions of instructions per second, like the one in your iPhone.


## Storage
### Memory (RAM)
- Random Access Memory
- temporary 
- fast
- volatile


It provides temporary storage for the operating system and running applications.

### Long term Storage

- Hard Drives, or SSDs
- Data is persisted even powered off
- Stores 
    - operating system, 
    - software applications, 
    - user files 

## Output
After processing data, the computer produces output

forms of output
- text
- 
## Software

Software refers to the programs and applications that users interact with.

Written in <b>programming languages</b>

Software instructs the computer on what tasks to perform.

- Operating System

    The operating system manages hardware resources and provides a user interface. It handles tasks like 
    - scheduling processes
    - managing memory
    - facilitating communication between software and hardware components

- Applications (anything else runs on a computing device)
    - Broswers
    - Games
    - Word Processing
    - 

## Networking

- Many connect to network (like Internet)
- Share data with other computer or devices
- Communication

## Power Management etc.
